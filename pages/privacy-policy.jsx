            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2"> In addition to the forgoing uses, we may also use personal information to contact Users through our opt-out mailing list to which all Users are added when they provide us with their email addresses. Users may at any time after signing up for the mailing list opt out to receiving information via the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of certain emails. Users should note that opting-out does not prevent us from contacting you regarding your account or any transactions. </p>
            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2"> Email marketing campaigns published by us may contain tracking facilities within the actual email.

This setting sends a special signal to the Sites you encounter while Web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to Web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about “do not track,” visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org" className="text-blue-700">www.allaboutdnt.org</a> </p>

            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2"> Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. </p>
            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2"> We use cookies to understand Site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings, or advertisements on our Site.

We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.</p>
            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2"> We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, and our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by us and/or other networks or sites.

            <li className="text-left m-3">Specifically, the following types of cookies may be used:</li>
            <li className="text-left m-3">"Non-session" cookies expire after thirty (30) days after using our Site.</li>

            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2">  Google Analytics may also associate the visitation information it collects with Google information from accounts of signed-in users who have consented to this association for the purpose of ads personalization. This Google information may include end user location, search history, YouTube history, and data from sites that partner with Google—and is used to provide aggregated and anonymized insights into your cross device behaviors.

            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2">Like most websites on the internet, we use remarketing to help promote our brand and products. This means that if you have visited our website before or shared your email with us, we can show you ads about our products and services on other websites in the future. One of the ways we do this is with the help of Google Ads Remarketing, Facebook Remarketing, Twitter Remarketing and other remarketing platforms.</p> 
            <p className=" text-gray-400 text-left mx-4 py-2">  Ads Remarketing is a remarketing and behavioral targeting service provided by Google. It connects the activity of www.beirresistible.com with the Google Ads advertising network and the Doubleclick Cookie. It allows us to share ads and banners to visitors of our website across the Doubleclick and Ads advertising networks.

            <li className="text-left m-3">Privacy Protection for Children Using the Internet</li>
